        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is popular because of its easy-to-learn syntax, extensive libraries, and versatility in various fields like web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "    - An interpreter in Python is a program that executes Python code line by line. Unlike compiled languages, Python does not require explicit compilation, making debugging easier and execution more flexible.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "    - Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meanings and cannot be used as variable names. Examples include if, else, for, while, def, class, return, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "    - No, keywords cannot be used as variable names because they are reserved for specific functionalities in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "    - Mutability refers to the ability of an object to change its contents after creation. Mutable objects can be modified, while immutable objects cannot.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "    - Lists are mutable because they allow changes in their elements after creation. Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after assignment, ensuring data integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between == and is operators in Python?\n",
        "    - == checks if two values are equal.\n",
        "    - is checks if two variables reference the same memory location.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "    - Logical operators in Python are used to perform logical operations:\n",
        "    - and (returns True if both conditions are true)\n",
        "    - or (returns True if at least one condition is true)\n",
        "    - not (reverses the logical state)\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "   - Type casting is the process of converting one data type into another, such as converting a string into an integer.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "    - Implicit Type Casting: Python automatically converts one data type to another (e.g., int to float).\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Explicit Type Casting: The user manually converts one data type to another using functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "    - Conditional statements control the flow of a program based on conditions, allowing execution of specific blocks of code when certain criteria are met.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "    - The elif statement (short for “else if”) allows multiple conditions to be checked in sequence, executing the first one that evaluates to True.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "    - for loops iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, range, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "    - while loops execute as long as a given condition remains true.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n",
        "    - A while loop is useful when the number of iterations is unknown beforehand, such as waiting for user input or processing data until a condition is met."
